# MMA

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KristofferC/MMA.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KristofferC/MMA.jl)

This module provides implements the MMA Algorithm in Julia as given by Krister Svanberg in (The method of moving asymptotes - a new method for structural optimization)[http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227631828_The_method_of_moving_asymptotesa_new_method_for_structural_optimization]

The module should mostly be seen as educational and for real use it is likely better to use one of the wrappers to more mature code, for example (NLopt.jl)[https://github.com/JuliaOpt/NLopt.jl]
